Creates colorful randomized images


Author: Luke Thomas
Date: March 3, 2016

Description: This program takes in user input to create randomly generated
pixel-painted images. Also has functionality to create a single image and
save it with a specific name, or create a bulk group of images with numbered
names.

Possible Improvements for the future:
- Create batches in separate folders instead of in the images folder
- Enable the creation of images with different patterns
- Improve the random color generation, right now some images can be bland
