Creates colorful randomized images


Author: Luke Thomas

Date: March 3, 2016

Description: 

This program takes in user input to create randomly generated
pixel-painted images. Also has functionality to create a single image and
save it with a specific name, or create a bulk group of images with numbered
names.

IMPORTANT: 
- MUST have python 3.4 found at (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
and PILLOW python library found at (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/3.1.1)

Installation Instructions:
- Go to the python download page (link provided above) and download the latest
version of python 3.4 (any version beginning with 3.4, such as 3.4.4 as of 3/3/16)
- Go to the PILLOW download page (link provided above) and download the latest
version of PILLOW for python 3.4, 3rd from the bottom for windows as of 3/3/16

Possible Improvements for the future:
- Create batches in separate folders instead of in the images folder
- Enable the creation of images with different patterns
- Improve the random color generation, right now some images can be bland
